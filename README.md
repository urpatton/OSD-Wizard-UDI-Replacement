## NOTES
```
	Created  based on functionality of the MDT UDI wizard
	OSD wizard will only function in Windows PE unless "-DebugWizard True" is used. This will prevent the task sequence invocation from running
	OSD wizard will not run in a task sequence run from the Software Center due to limitations preventing PowerShell from interacting with the user
	Pre-flight checks taken directly from UDI wizard checks and Microsoft website
	https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/deploymentguys/pre-flight-checks-ac-power-check
	
	Local administrator user account creation (OSDAddAdmin variable) is not supported outside of the MDT and is intentionally omitted.

## UDI WIZARD XML INTEGRATED FUNCTIONALITY
```
	NOTE: Parameter input will take precedence over UDI wizard settings
	
-Required Files
	UDIWizard_Config.xml - UDI wizard XML configuration file must exist in the script root folder (Located in the MDT "Scripts" folder) or your custom UDI wizard .xml file
	UDIWizard_Config.xml.app - UDI wizard applications file must exist in the script root folder if applications are loaded from the XML (Located in the MDT "Scripts" folder)
	UDI_Wizard_Banner.bmp - UDI wizard banner file must exist in the script root folder (Located in the MDT Tools\x64 folder)
	Note: CSV files "OSD___.csv" are still recognized and will take precedence over existing UDI wizard XML settings. This is done to simplify the input of things like the OU and applications list
	Use one of the "-SkipCSV___" parameters to skip importing invididual CSV files
	
-UDI Wizard Pages
	Pages must be present in the UDI wizard Stage Group stage "NEWCOMPUTER". All other Stage Groups, including "NEWCOMPUTER.Prestaged", are ignored
	Each UDI wizard page type can exist only once under the Stage Group stage "NEWCOMPUTER"
	Pages not present in the UDI XML "NEWCOMPUTER" Stage Group will be disabled and removed from the OSD wizard.
	
-Only the below UDI wizard page types are recognized
	Microsoft.OSDRefresh.ComputerPage
	Microsoft.SharedPages.AdminAccountsPage
	Microsoft.OSDRefresh.VolumePage
	Microsoft.OSDRefresh.BitLockerPage
	Microsoft.OSDRefresh.ConfigScanPage
	Microsoft.OSDRefresh.LanguagePage
	Microsoft.OSDRefresh.ApplicationPage
	
	All field validators are ignored
	Only UDI wizard aspects that directly correspond to an aspect in the OSD wizard will be recognized. All other UDI wizard settings are ignored.
	All "Locked" and "Unlocked" field settings are recognized
	
-Page aspects that are recognized/used or not used 
	Microsoft.OSDRefresh.ComputerPage
	All fields except "Domain or Workgroup" selection options and Workgroup field
	
	Microsoft.SharedPages.AdminAccountsPage
	Local administrator password field. Administrator account username is ignored
	Local administrator user account creation (OSDAddAdmin variable) is not supported outside of the MDT and is intentionally omitted.
	
	Microsoft.OSDRefresh.VolumePage
	Minimum Volume Size ignored
	User Data and Settings fields ignored
	
	Microsoft.OSDRefresh.BitLockerPage
	Only BitLocker checkbox is recognized (Initially check this checkbox in the wizard). All other aspects are ignored
	
	Microsoft.OSDRefresh.ConfigScanPage
	This only enables or disables the OSD wizard deployment readiness page
	Deployment readiness tab page (Microsoft.OSDRefresh.ConfigScanPage) validators are ignored.

	Microsoft.OSDRefresh.LanguagePage
	All fields recognized and used
	ListOfLanguages.csv is still required for the Language selection tab page
	Bug: Keyboard default language selection will be ignored if the XML keyboard local number (00000404) cannot be matched to a single existing language
	
	Microsoft.OSDRefresh.ApplicationPage
	Only Applications are recognized. Package/Programs are not recognized. (Possible support in a future version)
	Application groups are not recognized
	Application property mappings are ignored
```

## GENERAL FUNCTIONALITY
```
	OSD wizard will only function in Windows PE
	OSD wizard will not run in a task sequence run from the Software Center due to limitations preventing PowerShell from interacting with the user
	Use "-DebugWizard True" to allow functionality outside of Windows PE
	
	Logging
	Creates an "OSD_Wizard.log" file in the "_SMSTSLogPath" directory
	OSD_Wizard.Log logs the wizard output
		
	Wizard functionality and configurations
	Custom wizard Icon
	Include a ".ico" file in the script folder
	
	Custom wizard header/banner
	Include a ".bmp" file with the dimensions 759 x 69
	The UDI wizard banner listed in the XML file will take precedence over any other .bmp banner file
	NOTE: These are the same dimensions as the UDI wizard banner
	
	OU Selection dropdown list
	To populate the OU selection list
	Use the list from the UDI wizard XML
	Or, in the script folder include a CSV file named "OSDADOUList.csv" with a "Name" and "DistinguishedName" column
	Example:
	Name									DistinguishedName
	Sales Dept Workstations		OU=Workstations,OU=SalesDept,DC=Contoso,DC=Local
	NW Marketing Desktops		OU=Desktops,OU=Marketing,OU=NorthWestRegion,DC=Contoso,DC=Local
	
	OS Image selection dropdown list
	Use the list from the UDI wizard XML
	Or, in the script folder include a CSV file named "OSDOSImages.csv" with a "DisplayName" and "ImageName" column.
	When using multiple images, "ImageName" must match the logic for the "Apply Operating System Image" step matching the image name in the logic
	Items will appear in the dropdown list in the same order as the CSV
	Example:
	DisplayName							ImageName
	Windows 11 Enterprise 24H2		Windows 11 Enterprise 24H2 Base OS
	Windows 11 Enterprise 23H2		Windows 11 Enterprise 23H2 Base OS
	
	Language Selection page
	Use the list from the UDI wizard XML to set the default settings and lock the fields
	Items will appear in the dropdown list in the same order as the CSV
	OSDListOfLanguages.csv taken directly from ListOfLanguages.xml MDT "Scripts" folder
	To convert to CSV use this command
	([xml](Get-Content "\\Some\Pathto\OSDWizardRoot\ListOfLanguages.xml")).LOCALEDATA.LOCALE | ? { $_.SNAME -eq $_.SSPECIFICCULTURE } |
	select RefName, SNAME, SSPECIFICCULTURE, SENGDISPLAYNAME, DEFAULTKEYBOARD |
	ForEach-Object{
	[PSCustomObject]@{
	RefName		     = $_.RefName
	SNAME		     = $_.SNAME
	SSPECIFICCULTURE = $_.SSPECIFICCULTURE
	SENGDISPLAYNAME  = $_.SENGDISPLAYNAME
	DEFAULTKEYBOARD  = $_.DEFAULTKEYBOARD
	}
	} | Export-Csv "\\Some\Pathto\OSDWizardRoot\OSDListOfLanguages.csv" -NoTypeInformation -Force
	
	Use this command to generate an updated timezone list
	Items will appear in the dropdown list in the same order as the CSV
	Get-TimeZone -ListAvailable | Export-Csv -NoClobber -NoTypeInformation -Path "\\Some\Pathto\OSDWizardRoot\OSDTimeZonelist.csv"
	
	Applicaitons selection tab
	Items will appear in the dropdown list in the same order as the CSV
	Is empty by default
	To populate the Application selection list
	Use the list from the UDI wizard XML
	Or, in the script folder include a CSV file named "OSDApplications.csv" with the columns "DisplayName", "ApplicationName", "Required", and "Checked" columns
	Output creates "COALESCEDAPPS" variable for dynamic application installtion
	"ApplicationName" column is the applicaiton name of the app to be installed dynamically using
	"Required" column set to "True" will check all apps that are required installs. The apps can be unchecked, but will be rechecked when clicking "Next"
	"Checked" column set to "True" will check all apps that are default apps but are optional installs the user may uncheck
	Example:
	DisplayName				ApplicationName					Required	Checked
	Google Chrome			OSD - Chrome										TRUE
	Microsoft Office 365		OSD - Microsoft Office 365	TRUE
	Mozilla Firefox				OSD - Firefox										TRUE
	
	Task Sequence functionality and Configurations
	To run OSD Wizard, set task sequence step as "Run PowerShell Script" with execution policy in Bypass
	Set parameters as desired
	Wizard sets default task sequnce variable OSDWizardSuccess equals "False"
	OSDWizardSuccess is only set to "True" upon successfully completing the Wizard and clicking Finish
	When user cancelled "OSDSetupWizCancelled" returns "True". This is for MDT backward compatibility
	
	Format and Partition Disk task sequence step
	Variable name to store disk number should be set to "OSDDiskIndex"
	
	Enable BitLocker task sequence step
	NOTE: OSD wizard does not set Enable BitLocker step sub-settings, such as where to escrow the recovery key
	
	Task sequence step "Cancelled Wizard Group" logic
	TaskSequenceVariable OSDWizardSuccess equals "False"
	TaskSequenceVariable OSDSetupWizCancelled equals "True" (Legacy MDT variable left for backward compatibility)
